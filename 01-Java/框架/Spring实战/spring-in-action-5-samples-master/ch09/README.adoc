= Chapter 9 samples

This folder contains 2 subfolders:

 - `simple-flow` : Shows the simple example from section 9.1
 - `taco-cloud` : The Taco Cloud sample, updated with a new `tacocloud-email`
   subproject, with code from section 9.3. (It also includes changes to the
   API, Domain, and Data subprojects to support submitting orders via email.)

Section 9.2 contains many disjointed snippets, but no complete example.
Therefore, I have not included section 9.2 code in this folder. I may circle
back later and create one or more samples that use those snippets in more
complete samples.
