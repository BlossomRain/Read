<p>We love tacos. All kinds of tacos. And we love being creative with the way we make our tacos.</p>

<p>Some taco joints offer a set, finite menu of tacos to choose from. At Taco Cloud, we want to share
  the joy of taco creativity with you, allowing you to design your own tacos from a palette of fresh
  and delicious ingredients. While we may offer some of our creations for you to try, the real fun
  is when you create your own tortilla-wrapped works of art.</p>

<p>And, even though we love tacos and creativity, we prefer to avoid doing complex math. That's why
  all tacos are priced modestly at $4.99 each, no matter how many or what ingredients you choose.</p>
